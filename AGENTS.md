# Guide for AI agents

Read this before you change Noryx. What the programs do is described for users in [docs/](docs/), and
[docs/security.md](docs/security.md) describes the guarantees every change has to keep.

## Project

Noryx manages Minecraft servers and whole networks from one admin panel. It consists of two programs:

- `noryx-master` serves the panel and its REST API, keeps the SQLite database and its own certificate authority, and
  controls the agents over gRPC with mutual TLS.
- `noryx-agent` runs on every dedicated server and runs its Minecraft servers in Docker. It only obeys the master and
  its local CLI on a Unix socket; never add another way to control it.

## Working rules

- Organise code by feature, not by layer: the master, the agent and the panel each keep a feature in one package or
  folder. Clean up what doesn't fit.
- Plan before you write code. When something is unclear, ask instead of guessing.
- Keep code as short and clear as it can be: rewrite 100 lines that could be 40.
- Think about security before you implement anything: where input comes from, who may send it and what a compromised
  master, agent or server could do with it.
- Use current versions of languages, libraries and APIs.

## Checks

Run what CI runs before you push:

| Command                                                   | Checks                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `go test -race ./...`                                     | all Go tests, including the end-to-end tests              |
| `golangci-lint run ./...`                                 | Go code (CI uses golangci-lint v2.14.0)                   |
| `cd web && npm run lint && npm run build`                 | oxlint, the translations, TypeScript and the build        |
| `make generate`                                           | the generated gRPC code; CI fails while it is out of date |
| `shellcheck packaging/*.sh packaging/*/*.sh scripts/*.sh` | the shell scripts                                         |

The tests need Linux. [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) explains how to run master, agent and panel locally.

## Conventions

- **Master and agent** talk only through `api/noryx/v1`: change the `.proto` files, run `make generate`, and keep rules
  that both sides check next to the generated code. The agent validates every request itself.
- **Database:** add a migration as the next `internal/master/database/migrations/NNNN_name.sql`. Never change a released
  one: the master runs each migration only once.
- **REST API:** register routes with `access.Mux.Handle` and the permission they need. Terminal commands check their
  permission the same way.
- **Secrets** such as the RCON password, forwarding secrets, secrets of file sets and database passwords never reach the
  panel and are never logged.
- **Panel texts** are English and serve as translation keys: `t("…")`, `<Trans>` for texts with markup, `msg("…")`
  outside of components. Run `npm run i18n` in `web` and translate new texts in `web/src/locales/de.json`.
- **Commits** start with one sentence in the imperative that says what changes, e.g. "Let a network change its proxy",
  with details in the body.

## Documentation

- The [README](README.md) stays short: what Noryx is, how to install it and where to read on. Don't describe features
  there.
- Describe a feature in its page under [docs/](docs/), and keep [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) true. A new page
  also goes into the table of the README.

## Pull requests and release notes

Fill in the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md). Its **Release notes** section becomes part of the
notes of the next release, which administrators also read in the panel:

- One line per change they notice, starting with `New:`, `Improved:`, `Fixed:` or `Security:`. Write what they can do
  now or what no longer goes wrong, not how the code does it.
- Leave the section empty for refactoring, tests, CI, documentation and fixes of something not released yet.
- The panel renders the notes with a small Markdown renderer: use **bold**, `code` and links, but no nested lists,
  tables or images.

`scripts/release-notes.sh <tag>` prints the notes a release gets; it needs `gh` signed in.
