# Installation and operation

Installing, updating and removing Noryx, and where it keeps its files.

## Supported systems

Releases contain packages for Debian, Ubuntu and their derivatives (`.deb`), Fedora, RHEL, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux and
openSUSE (`.rpm`) and Arch Linux, each for x86_64 and arm64. Only current Linux systems with systemd and OpenSSL 3 are
supported, e.g. Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04, RHEL, Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux 9, openSUSE Leap 16 and newer. The installer
picks the package, checks the signature of the release and the package's checksum and sets everything up. Running it
again updates, and `--version vX.Y.Z` installs a certain release. While another installation of packages runs, e.g. the
automatic updates of a new server, it waits up to 10 minutes and says so. It asks questions only when started from a
file as below; piped to `sudo bash`, it uses the defaults instead, because `sudo-rs`, the `sudo` of newer Ubuntu
releases, doesn't pass on what is typed then.

## Master

The master serves the panel:

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/QwikByte/noryx/releases/latest/download/install.sh && sudo bash install.sh master
```

It asks for the host name or IP address under which the nodes reach this machine (`--public-host`), for the IP address
and port the panel listens at (`--panel-addr`, `127.0.0.1:8080` by default, `0.0.0.0:<port>` for all interfaces, ports
from 1024 on), and for the password of the first administrator, `admin` unless `--admin` names another (piped, it
generates one and writes it to `/etc/noryx/admin-password`, which only root can read). The password needs at least 12
characters and isn't shown while you type it. These options only apply to a new installation; later, both addresses can
be changed in the panel's settings.

Open port 9443 for the nodes. For plugins and mods, the master needs HTTPS access to `api.modrinth.com` and
`cdn.modrinth.com`.

### HTTPS

Browsers only sign in over HTTPS or at `localhost`. Until the panel serves HTTPS, open it through an SSH tunnel, e.g.
`ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 <user>@<master>` and `http://localhost:8080`. Then either turn on HTTPS under [**Settings →
General**](administration.md#general): a certificate of Let's Encrypt for a domain, or a self-signed one, which also
works for IP addresses but makes browsers warn. Or serve the panel with a reverse proxy, e.g. with
[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) and this `Caddyfile`, which also gets the certificate:

```
panel.example.com {
	reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}
```

Then add `--trusted-proxy 127.0.0.1` to `NORYX_MASTER_OPTS` in `/etc/noryx/master.env`, so that the master takes the
address of each client from the proxy's `X-Forwarded-For` header. Otherwise all clients share the proxy's address, and
with it the budget of the sign-in rate limit, and the log and the sessions of users show only the proxy's address.

## Nodes

Add a node in the panel under **Nodes**. It shows a command that installs the agent in the master's version, offers to
install Docker if it's missing (`--install-docker` doesn't ask) or installs [Podman](#docker-or-podman) with
`--runtime podman`, connects the agent with a join token and starts it:

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/QwikByte/noryx/releases/download/<version>/install.sh && sudo bash install.sh agent --join <join-token>
```

Allow port 7443 only from the master's IP address. For the [private network](networks.md#private-network) of the nodes,
open UDP port 51820 (or the one in its settings) between the nodes.

**Remove node…** in a node's menu stops managing it, also while it is offline or lost. Its servers and datastores keep
running until they are stopped on the node or the agent is uninstalled. Servers of networks
[leave their networks](networks.md#deleting-and-removed-nodes) first, once confirmed.

### Docker or Podman

Each node runs all its servers and datastores with one runtime: Docker, or [Podman](https://podman.io) as root, which
the steps to add a node offer too. With `--runtime podman`, the installer installs Podman from the system's packages if
it's missing, starts its socket (`podman.socket`), lets `podman-restart.service` start the servers at boot and sets
the agent to Podman. Podman needs version 4.9 or newer, e.g. of Debian 13, Ubuntu 24.04 or RHEL 9, and a kernel with
the bridge support and the lookups of routes of nftables (`nft_meta_bridge`, `nft_fib_inet`), which current
distributions have.

Podman runs the same containers as Docker, from the same images, with the same users, capabilities, limits and networks
(see [Containers](security.md#containers)), and it needs no daemon of its own. The agent talks to its
Docker-compatible API and makes up for where Podman behaves differently, e.g. how it tells crashes and health. Plain
processes without containers aren't offered: the agent would have to download and check Java and the servers itself,
supervise and restart them, give each one a user of its own and build the isolation of containers again. Only Podman as
root is supported: the agent runs as root anyway, and rootless Podman forwards published ports through a process of its
own, past the firewall of the private network that lets only a proxy's node reach a port; its containers have no
addresses on the node, at which the agent reaches their consoles, and it maps their users to others, which the data
directories would have to follow.

To set up Podman by hand on a node whose agent is installed:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now podman.socket
sudo systemctl enable podman-restart.service
sudo systemctl enable --now noryx-isolate.service   # keeps the servers apart before Podman starts them at boot
```

Then add `--runtime podman` to `NORYX_AGENT_OPTS` in `/etc/noryx/agent.env` and run
`sudo systemctl restart noryx-agent`; `--runtime-socket <path>` names another socket than `/run/podman/podman.sock`.
The agent refuses a socket at which the other runtime answers, e.g. Podman behind Docker's socket through the package
`podman-docker`, and a Podman before 4.9: calls then fail and say why.

The runtime is chosen per node, not per server, as each runtime keeps its servers apart with networks and firewall
rules of its own. A node doesn't take its servers along to another runtime: move them to another node first, then
change the runtime and move them back.

Where Podman behaves differently:

- Podman before 5.8 starts only containers whose restart policy is **Always** at boot, so the agent gives them that
  policy there: a server or datastore stopped in the panel starts again when the node boots. From 5.8 on, stopped ones
  stay stopped, like with Docker.
- At shutdown, `podman-restart.service` stops the servers. Raise its `TimeoutStopSec` like Docker's (see
  [Settings and images](servers.md#settings-and-images)).
- Podman before 5.8 tells the time of console lines in whole seconds, so a console that reconnects may show a line
  again.

## Everything on one machine

`sudo bash install.sh all` installs master and agent, registers the machine as node and connects its agent, which then
only accepts connections from the machine itself.

## Updates

The master looks for a new release every 6 hours. Administrators then see a notice in the panel with the release notes
and install it with **Install now**: the master installs the release, restarts on it, and then updates every agent to
its version, also the one on its own machine. Running services restart; Minecraft servers keep running. The panel of
every signed-in user reloads once the master runs the new version, unless that would lose something, such as unsaved
changes in an editor or running uploads; then it waits until they are done. Agents that are older than the master, e.g.
as they were offline or their update failed, are listed in the notice and in the **Agents** tab of the settings:
**Update** next to one updates it alone, **Update all** in the notice all of them. The master updates all agents by
itself only after **Install now**, so after updating it on its host, a release can be tried on one node first. The check
can be turned off in the settings, e.g. for a master
without internet access. While GitHub's API limits the requests of the master's IP address (60 an hour, shared with
everything behind the same address), the master reads only the version from the release page, and the panel links to the
release notes on GitHub. On the command line, `… | sudo bash -s -- update` updates what is installed; update the master
first, then the nodes.

## Files and logs

| Where                                           | What                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/noryx/master.env`, `/etc/noryx/agent.env` | Options of the services, e.g. listen addresses or a log file; `systemctl restart` applies them |
| `/var/lib/noryx-master`, `/var/lib/noryx-agent` | Database and CA of the master; credentials, server data and backups of the agent               |
| `journalctl -u noryx-master`, `-u noryx-agent`  | What the services log; `--log-format json` in the options suits log collectors                 |

## Commands

### On the master's host

Commands run as the master's user `noryx`: `sudo -u noryx noryx-master logs` shows the log, `… user add <name>` creates
an administrator, e.g. after losing access, `… node add <name> <agent-address> --public-enroll-addr <host:port>` adds a
node and prints its join token for scripts, and `… backup <file>` saves the master's database and CA (see [Backing up
the master](automation.md#backing-up-the-master)).

### On a node

`sudo noryx-agent status` checks the node, `server logs <id>` follows a console, `datastore logs <id>` the log of a
datastore and `logs -f` the agent's own log.
`backup list <id>`, `backup create <id>` and `backup restore <id> <backup-id>` work while the master is unreachable too.
`storage add ssd /mnt/ssd/noryx` allows another directory for server data, e.g. on a faster disk; new servers can then
be created there from the panel, and backup jobs can keep their backups there. `overlay allow` lets the panel add the
node to the private network of the nodes, `overlay deny` takes that back, and `overlay status` shows its address,
peers, firewall rules and the ports it publishes there.

## Removing

`apt remove`, `dnf remove` or `pacman -R` with `noryx-master` or `noryx-agent` stops and removes a program but keeps its
data. Delete `/var/lib/noryx-master`, `/var/lib/noryx-agent` and `/etc/noryx` to remove that too. The Minecraft servers
of a node keep running in Docker or Podman; delete them in the panel before.

## Installing by hand and verifying releases

Each release also has `.tar.gz` archives with the static binary, its systemd unit and its options, for other
distributions: the unit expects the binary in `/usr/bin`, the options in `/etc/noryx` and, for the master, a system user
`noryx`. `checksums.txt` lists the SHA-256 checksums of all files, and
`gh attestation verify <file> --repo QwikByte/noryx` proves that a file was built by the release workflow.
`checksums.txt.sig` is the signature of the checksums, which the installer checks with the release key. To check files
by hand, e.g. `install.sh` before the first installation, download `checksums.txt` and `checksums.txt.sig` too:

```sh
printf -- '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMCowBQYDK2VwAyEA18ilyBW0qkWpfEqFR+rW5eQeGC3Sif4OiD8RKpEry5s=\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n' > noryx-release.pem
openssl pkeyutl -verify -pubin -inkey noryx-release.pem -rawin -in checksums.txt -sigfile checksums.txt.sig
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing checksums.txt
```
