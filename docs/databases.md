# Databases

A [network](networks.md) gets datastores: MariaDB or PostgreSQL servers that the agent of a node of its choice runs from
the official `mariadb` and `postgres` images, for plugins that keep their data in SQL and share it across the network,
e.g. LuckPerms, LiteBans, Plan or CoreProtect (which only speaks MySQL). A network has up to 10 datastores, and each up
to 50 databases, each with a user of the same name that has rights on that database only.

## Creating

The network's **Databases** tab creates a datastore with a name, an engine, a node, a storage location and its memory,
which counts against the node's memory limit like that of servers. It gets the newest major version the agent knows
(MariaDB 11.8 and 12.3, PostgreSQL 17 and 18). Its data lives in `<location>/datastores/<id>/data-<version>`, owned by
the image's user.

## Reaching a datastore

The network's servers on the datastore's node, the proxy included, join its internal network `noryx-db-<id>`,
which has no route to the internet, while they run, and keep it when their container is created again; they reach it by
the name of its container. Servers of other nodes reach it over the [private network of the
nodes](networks.md#private-network) if both nodes are part of it: the datastore's node publishes its port there, for the
nodes of the network's servers only, once the network is applied, e.g. after a node joined; a node that leaves applies
its networks again. Without the private network, servers of other nodes can't reach it, and the file sets that use it
tell why. Moving a server to a node that can't reach the datastores of its network needs a confirmation.

## Connection

**Connection** on the tab shows what to enter into the configuration of a plugin: the host and port for the servers on
the datastore's node (`noryx-db-<id>` and 3306 or 5432), those for the servers of other nodes once it is published (the
node's address in the private network and the datastore's port, which it keeps), and the database and its user, which
share their name. The master generates the password of each database: 32 characters from `a-z2-7`, which need no quoting
in YAML, TOML, HOCON or properties files. Only those who may manage datastores see it, once they ask for it. A [file
set](library.md#databases) fills in all of them for each server, e.g. `{{datastore:main.luckperms.host}}`, the password
out of sight. **New password** gives a user another one, which the plugins that use the database need then; the file
sets that use it show their servers as outdated until they are applied again.

## Usage

Each datastore on the tab shows its CPU, its memory of its limit and its connections now, with small lines of the last
24 hours; **History** charts them and the size of its data over the last day or week, like the history of a server.
The agent measures them every 5 seconds next to those of the servers: CPU and memory like `docker stats`, and the
clients connected to the engine, without its own query, which it builds itself (`information_schema.PROCESSLIST` of
MariaDB, `pg_stat_activity` of PostgreSQL); a datastore that isn't ready yet tells no connections. The master records
them every minute while the datastore runs and keeps them for a week, and deleting the datastore deletes them. Those who
may see datastores see its usage.

## Browsing

**Browse** looks into a database: its tables with their estimated rows and size, and their columns and rows 50 at a
time, with values cut to 200 characters and binary ones in hexadecimal. Rows come in the order of the primary key, or
of a column whose header is clicked, first ascending, then descending, and then in the order of the primary key again.
The filter above the rows shows those whose value of a column contains a text, ignoring case, or is exactly a text: the
value as text, as the page shows it, binary values in hexadecimal like `0x00FF` for MariaDB and `\x00ff` for PostgreSQL.
The table, the first row, the sort and the filter are in the page's address. Browsing only reads, with no more rights
than the database's user, also only for those who may manage datastores, and the agent checks the columns to sort and
filter by against those of the table.

## Log

**Show log** on the tab follows the log of the datastore's container: what MariaDB or PostgreSQL writes, e.g. why it
doesn't start or why its health check fails, which the message about a failing health check links to. It starts with the
last 300 lines and continues when the datastore starts again. The agent hides the passwords in the statements that the
engines log, e.g. when one fails: `ALTER ROLE shop PASSWORD '…'` shows as `ALTER ROLE shop PASSWORD '<hidden>'`, and
the same for `PASSWORD('…')`, `IDENTIFIED BY '…'` and `USING '…'`. Only those who may manage datastores see the log. On
the node and in the panel's terminal, `noryx-agent datastore logs <id>` follows it too, after the last 100 lines or as
many as `-n` asks for, up to 1000.

## Backups

**Back up now** and backup jobs dump the databases into a ZIP archive with one `<database>.sql` each
(`mariadb-dump --single-transaction`, `pg_dump`), kept next to the backups of servers in
`<backups of the location>/datastores/<id>`, while the datastore keeps running; **Back up now** asks for a label and the
databases, all at first. Restoring asks for the databases of the dump, all at first, creates them again and loads them
as each database's own user; one that was dropped since has to be added again first. The plugins that use them lose
their connection meanwhile, so their servers are best stopped first. Dumps can be downloaded. Locally,
`noryx-agent datastore list|backup|backups|restore` works without the master, and the panel's terminal does all but
restore.

### Uploading a dump

**Upload** adds a dump made elsewhere, e.g. when an existing LuckPerms database moves to Noryx: a ZIP archive with a
`<database>.sql` for each database, named like the databases, or the SQL file of one database, which goes into the
database chosen. It may have up to 16 GB. The agent keeps it like the dumps it makes, and restoring it loads it the
same way, which the dialog offers right after the upload; its databases have to be added on the tab first. An archive
may contain folders and the `__MACOSX` folder that macOS adds, which are left out, but no other files, at most 1000
entries and 50 databases, and its SQL files may unpack to at most 64 GB and 100 times the size of the archive.

A dump is loaded as the database's own user, so it gets no rights that this user doesn't have: make it of one
database, without its owner and privileges, e.g. with `mariadb-dump luckperms` or
`pg_dump --no-owner --no-privileges luckperms`. Statements that need more, e.g. `CREATE DATABASE` or `USE` of another
database, a `DEFINER` of another user or `ALTER … OWNER TO` another role, fail the restore at that statement. The
commands of the clients themselves are refused, as are files that MariaDB's client would send for `LOAD DATA LOCAL`:
MariaDB's client runs in binary mode and its sandbox, which only allow `DELIMITER`, and psql in its restricted mode,
which refuses `\!`, `\connect`, `\copy`, `\i`, `\o` and all others. Dumps of `pg_dump` since PostgreSQL 17.6 wrap
themselves in `\restrict` and `\unrestrict`, which the agent leaves out at their start and end.

## Upgrades and changes

The settings change the memory and CPU limits, download the newest image of the version, or move the datastore to a
newer major version: the agent dumps the databases, creates the datastore again on new data, loads the dumps and creates
the users again with the hashes of their passwords, while the plugins can't reach the databases. A failure goes back to
the old version, and its data stays until it is removed on the tab. The overview lists datastores that are unhealthy, or
stopped while servers of their network run.

## Deleting

Deleting a datastore, once its name is typed, removes its container, network, data and dumps. A network with datastores
can't be deleted.
